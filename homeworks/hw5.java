       Due Thursday, September 10
       Write a program to compute the dimensions (width and height) of a screen given the diagonal and the aspect ratio.Here are the formulas:x = sqrt( y^2 / ( 1 + a^2 ))  h = xand w = axwhereh = height (inches)w = width (inches)y = diagonal (inches)a = aspect ratioAsk the user for the inputs (diagonal and aspect ratio), call a subprogram to compute the dimensions (height and width), and then display the result.  The subprogram must return both width and height, so create a 'record' that combines the two into one unit.  (To save time, you don't have to check for input errors.)* by y^2, I mean y-squared
